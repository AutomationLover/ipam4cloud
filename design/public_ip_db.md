# Public IP Address Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented public IP address management in the Prefix Management System according to the DB design requirements.

## What Was Added

### 1. Public VRF Creation
- **Added to `02_seed_data.sql`:**
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO vrf (vrf_id, description, is_default, routable_flag)
  VALUES ('public-vrf', 'Public IP Address VRF', FALSE, TRUE)
  ON CONFLICT (vrf_id) DO NOTHING;
  ```

### 2. New PrefixManager Methods
- **`create_public_ip_prefix(vpc_id, cidr, tags)`**: Creates VPC-associated public IPs
  - Format: `{vpc_id}-subnet-{ip_formatted}`
  - Source: `vpc`
  - VRF: `public-vrf`
  - Routable: `true`
  - VPC Children Type Flag: `true`

- **`create_standalone_public_ip_prefix(cidr, tags)`**: Creates standalone public IPs
  - Format: `public-ip-{ip_formatted}`
  - Source: `manual`
  - VRF: `public-vrf`
  - Routable: `true`
  - VPC Children Type Flag: `false`

### 3. Demo Public IP Addresses Added

#### VPC1 (Production) Public IPs:
- `52.23.45.67/32` - Load Balancer IP
- `54.123.78.90/32` - NAT Gateway IP
- `3.45.67.89/32` - API Gateway IP

#### VPC2 (Development) Public IPs:
- `18.45.123.45/32` - Test Load Balancer IP
- `34.67.89.12/32` - Dev NAT Gateway IP

#### Standalone Public IPs:
- `203.0.113.10/32` - Company Website IP
- `198.51.100.25/32` - Backup Service IP

## Database Schema Compliance

According to the DB design document, public IP addresses follow these rules:

✅ **Prefix ID**: `vpcid-subnet-prefix` format for VPC-associated IPs  
✅ **VRF ID**: `public-vrf` (created as preset VRF)  
✅ **Prefix**: Using /32 format (e.g., `1.1.1.1/32`)  
✅ **Indentation Level**: 0 (no parent)  
✅ **Source**: `vpc` for VPC-associated, `manual` for standalone  
✅ **Routable Flag**: `true` (all public IPs are routable)  
✅ **VPC Children Type Flag**: `true` for VPC-associated, `false` for standalone  

## How to View Public IP Addresses

### 1. In the Prefix View (Management Interface)
- Go to: `http://localhost:8080/prefixes`
- Filter by VRF: Select "PUBLIC VRF public-vrf"
- You'll see all public IP addresses with /32 CIDR

### 2. In the Read-Only Interface
- Go to: `http://localhost:8080/readonly/prefixes`
- Filter by VRF: Select "PUBLIC VRF public-vrf"
- View-only access to all public IPs

### 3. Search for Specific Public IPs
- Use the search box with IP addresses: `52.23.45.67`
- Search by service tags: `service:load-balancer`
- Search by environment: `env:prod`

### 4. VRF View
- Go to: `http://localhost:8080/vrfs` or `http://localhost:8080/readonly/vrfs`
- You'll see the "public-vrf" with prefix count
- Click the prefix count to view all public IPs in that VRF

## Running the Demo

To populate the database with public IP addresses, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
# Wait for services to start, then run:
docker-compose exec app python main.py
```

This will create:
- The public-vrf VRF
- All sample public IP addresses
- Proper associations with VPCs

## Public IP Address Features

### Tags and Metadata
Each public IP includes rich metadata:
- **Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "prod-app-lb-ip")
- **Service**: Service type (load-balancer, nat-gateway, api-gateway)
- **Environment**: env tag (prod, dev)
- **VPC ID**: Associated VPC UUID (for VPC-related IPs)
- **Owner**: Responsible team (for standalone IPs)

### VRF Display Enhancement
The VRF display now shows:
- **Public VRF**: Clearly labeled as "Public IP Address VRF"
- **Enhanced formatting**: VRF names are parsed and displayed nicely
- **Prefix counts**: Shows how many public IPs are in the VRF

### Search and Filter Capabilities
- **By IP address**: Direct IP search
- **By service type**: Find all load balancer IPs
- **By environment**: Filter prod vs dev IPs
- **By VPC association**: Find IPs for specific VPCs
- **By tags**: Any tag-based search

## Example Queries

### Find all production public IPs:
Search: `env:prod`

### Find all load balancer IPs:
Search: `service:load-balancer`

### Find IPs for a specific VPC:
Search: `vpc_id:{vpc-uuid}`

### Find a specific public IP:
Search: `52.23.45.67`
